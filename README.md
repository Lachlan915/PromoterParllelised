# Promoter Parllelised
The Promoter program is a bioinformatics tool that uses the Smith-Waterman-Gotoh algorithm for local DNA sequence alignment. It identifies homologous genes and predicts promoter regions in genomic data using BLOSUM62 scoring and Sigma70 consensus patterns, ideal for genomic research and DNA analysis.
